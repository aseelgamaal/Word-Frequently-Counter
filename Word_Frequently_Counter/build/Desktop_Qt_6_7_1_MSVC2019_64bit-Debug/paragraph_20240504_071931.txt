My daily routine is a structured plan that keeps me organized and productive. I start my day at 6 AM with a morning workout to energize myself. Afterward, I have a healthy breakfast that prepares me for the tasks ahead. I dedicate my morning hours to work or studies, taking short breaks to stay focused.
